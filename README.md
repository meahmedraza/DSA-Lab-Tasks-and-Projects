## 📝 Topics Covered

- Arrays & Recursion  
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Insertion, Quick, Merge)  
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)  
- Stacks & Queues  
- Trees (Binary Tree, BST)  
- Graph Traversing (BFS, DFS)  
- File Handling with DSA  
- Mini Management Systems (School, University, Flight, Airline, Portal)  
- Text Editor in C++  

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmedraza/DSA-Lab-Tasks-and-Projects.git


2. Navigate to the specific lab/project folder.

3. Compile and run the code:
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output



## 📖 Notes

These are academic practice tasks and projects created during **Data Structures & Algorithms labs**.

The goal is to demonstrate understanding of **DSA concepts** and their application in small-scale projects.

Larger advanced projects (like **College Management System**) are uploaded separately in dedicated repositories.
